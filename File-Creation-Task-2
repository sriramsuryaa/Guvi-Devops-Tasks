File Creation Task 2:

Create 20 files with .txt extensions and rename the first 5 files to .yml extension and
Print the latest created top 5 files among the total no of files.


I've used for loop to create the 20 files sequentially.

$>  for ((i=1; i<=20; i++)); do touch file-$i.txt; sleep 1; done


After that listing the created file using

$>  ls -ltrh 


Again I've used the for loop to rename the first .txt files to .yml files.

$>  for ((i=1; i<=5; i++)); do mv file-$i.txt file-$i.yml; sleep 1; done 


After that checked files

$> ls 


Finally, I used these two ways to print the 5 latest created files among all

$> ls -lt | head -n6 | tail -n5 

$> ls -t | head -n5
